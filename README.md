Designing an Online Shopping System Database
In this project, I have designed, built, and populated a database for an imaginary online shopping system. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a database is needed to manage various aspects of an e-commerce platform, including product inventory, customer data, orders, and transactions.

Business Scenario
The online shopping system has grown rapidly and requires a robust database to handle customer data, product information, orders, inventory, and transactions efficiently. The aim is to transition from a basic data management system to a comprehensive database that can support the growing needs of the business.

Project Steps
Step 1: Information Gathering

Understanding the business requirements and technical needs.
Drafting business and technical proposal documents to outline the database design process.
Step 2: Design Process

Creating database diagrams using tools like Lucidchart to visually represent the database structure.
Step 3: Implementation

-Using SQL DDL commands to create the database schema.
Populating the database with sample data using SQL DML commands.
Demonstrating the effectiveness of the database with SQL CRUD operations.
